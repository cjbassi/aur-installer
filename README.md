# aur-installer

Easily install any package from the AUR when you have no AUR helper installed.

Useful for installing an AUR helper for the first time such as [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay).

Simply run:

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjbassi/aur-installer/master/aur-installer) yay-bin
```
